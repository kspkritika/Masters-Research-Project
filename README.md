# Masters-Research-Project
Here is my MS research project done at Cornell University under Dr. Jeffrey D Varner. We have solved a biological problem through mathematical modeling and computational simulation. We have used principles derived from control theory, optimization, matrix manipulation, linear programming and non linear programming to solve the problem. The file Data_Cybernetics.jl is simply to load all the biological data that we have. We have saved the biological data in excel sheet and it is interpreted by the code as a matrix. The main problem is solved in Dynamic_multi_ode.jl. The differential equation package in julia has been used to integrate the ordinary differential equations in time. The results have been plotted using PyPlot. The various equations used describe the biological data as per Michaelis Menten equation, Monod equation and are non linear in nature. The problem is controlled via using 2 variables u and v which vary between 0 and 1. After solving the ode equations, there is a need to determine the feasible ensemble of parameters that satisfy the problem. Non linear optimization has been used for this purpose. Objective.jl declares an objective function that is further being optimized in run_optim.jl using Nelder-Mead algorithm
